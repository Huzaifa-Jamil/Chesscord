# Chesscord

A multiplayer Chess and real-time Chat platform built in C++  powered by a Qt6 TCP server and a plain terminal CMD client. Every data structure is implemented from scratch ;) no STD containers used.

---

## Features

- **Multiplayer Chess:** Play chess in real time against another player over TCP server.
- **Real time Chat:** Send and receive messages during a live game session.
- **Terminal UI:** Plain CMD terminal interface just run the exe and play.
- **Auth System:** Token based authentication with a 10 second timeout for unverified connections.
- **Reconnect Support:** Returning users (same IP address) are recognized and welcomed back automatically.
- **Matchmaking Queue:** Players are paired automatically once two are waiting.
- **Friend Graph:** Adjacency matrix tracks opponent relationships after every completed game.
- **Move Validation:** Full chess move validation runs on both client and server independently.
- **Pawn Promotion:** Prompted automatically when a pawn reaches the last rank.
- **Disconnect Handling:** Surviving player is declared winner and re-queued if opponent disconnects mid game.
- **GCP Deployed:** Server runs live on Google Cloud Platform (e2-micro, Ubuntu 22.04, port 8080).
- **No STL Containers:** Every data structure is hand built from scratch in C++.

## Data Structures, Why Each One Was Chosen

| Structure | File | Used For | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Doubly Linked List** | `LinkedList.h` | Pending (unauthenticated) connections | Fast insert/remove from both ends and middle; nodes store socket + IP + token buffer for clients not yet verified |
| **HashMap (Chaining)** | `HashMap.h` | Active authenticated users | O(1) average lookup by `userId`; multiplicative hash over a 100-bucket table |
| **Linked Queue** | `Queue.h` | Matchmaking queue | FIFO ordering ensures fair pairing; supports `remove(userId)` for mid queue disconnects |
| **AVL Tree** | `AVLTree.h` | Persistent user storage | Self balancing BST keeps all registered users sorted by `userId`; supports `findByIp()` for reconnect detection |
| **Stack** | `Stack.h` | Move history (generic template) | LIFO structure for tracking game moves per session |
| **Adjacency Matrix Graph** | `FriendGraph.h` | Friend/opponent relationship tracking | 1000×1000 matrix records which users have played each other; updated after every completed game |
| **4-Directional Linked Grid** | `ChessBoard.h` | Chess board representation | Each cell links to its up/down/left/right neighbor, making path clear validation a natural pointer traversal |

---

## Protocol

All messages follow a `TAG|data\n` format defined in `Protocol.h`.

| Tag | Direction | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `AUTH\|SEND_TOKEN` | Server → Client | Server requests auth token on connect |
| `AUTH\|CHESS123456PLEASEAUTH` | Client → Server | Client sends the auth token |
| `AUTH\|OK\|<id>` | Server → Client | Auth accepted, user ID assigned |
| `AUTH\|RECONNECT` | Server → Client | Returning user recognized by IP |
| `AUTH\|DUPLICATE` | Server → Client | User already connected, rejected |
| `WAIT\|<message>` | Server → Client | Status messages (looking for opponent, welcome, etc.) |
| `START\|<oppId>\|<color>\|<board>` | Server → Client | Match found, board state and color assigned |
| `GAME\|<move>` | Client → Server | Player submits a move (e.g. `e2e4`) |
| `GAME\|<move>\|<board>` | Server → Client | Move verified, updated board state sent |
| `GAME\|INVALID` | Server → Client | Move rejected by server validation |
| `GAME\|CHECK` | Server → Client | King is in check warning |
| `GAME\|PROMOTE\|<move>` | Server → Client | Pawn promotion required |
| `CHAT\|<message>` | Client → Server | Send a chat message |
| `CHAT\|<message>` | Server → Client | Receive opponent's chat message |
| `WIN\|` | Server → Client | You won |
| `LOSS\|` | Server → Client | You lost |
| `TIE\|` | Server → Client | Draw |
| `END\|` | Server → Client | Game session closed |

## Live Server Invitation

You are welcome to try Chesscord online.

A public Chesscord server is currently running on Google Cloud Platform and is available for anyone who would like to test the project.

To join:

1. Download and install the latest client from the Releases section Link: https://github.com/Huzaifa-Jamil/Chesscord/releases/download/v5.0.0/ChessCord_v5.0.0_Setup.exe 
2. Launch the client.
3. Connect and start playing chess with other online players.

The public server is planned to remain online from **June 9, 2026** until **July 9, 2026** (Only if my GCP credits do not run out).

Please note that the server is hosted on a small GCP e2-micro instance for demonstration and testing purposes. Temporary downtime may occur during maintenance, updates or resource limitations.

Have fun and feel free to report bugs, suggestions, or feedback through GitHub Issues.


## How to Build & Run (Locally)

Make Sure you install CMake Extension in VS Code *(CMake Tools by Microsoft)*

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Huzaifa-Jamil/Chesscord.git
cd Chesscord
```

---

### Step 2: Build the Server

Open the `server/` folder as its own VS Code workspace:

```bash
 cd server
```

In VS Code:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → **CMake: Configure**
2. Select your compiler (e.g. GCC or G++ with Qt6)
3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → **CMake: Build** OR Just Open server.cpp File and press F7 Key to initiate build commands

The compiled binary will be placed in:

```
server/build/server.exe       # Windows
server/build/server           # Linux / macOS
```

To run the server:

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
server\build\server.exe
```

**Linux**
```bash
./server/build/server
```

You should see:
```
[INFO] Server is waiting for clients all over the world on port 8080
```

---

### Step 3: Build the Client

Open the `client/` folder as its own VS Code workspace *(separate window from the server)*:

```bash
 cd client
```

In VS Code:

1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → **CMake: Configure**
2. Select your compiler
3. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` → **CMake: Build** OR Just Open client.cpp File and press F7 Key to initiate build commands.

The compiled binary will be placed in:

```
client/build/client.exe       # Windows
client/build/client           # Linux / macOS
```

To run the client:

**Windows (CMD):**
```cmd
client\build\client.exe
```

**Linux:**
```bash
./client/build/client
```

> **Note:** The client connects to the GCP server (Windows local Host) at `127.0.0.1` by default.
> To connect to your local server instead (on Linus etc.), change the IP in `client/client.cpp`:
> ```cpp
> pSocket->connectToHost("your local host address", 8080);
> ```
> Then rebuild the client. (Repeat Step 1,2 and 3)

---


## Deploying the our own Server on GCP (Ubuntu 22.04 Only If you want Deployment)

### Step 1: SSH into your instance and install dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cmake g++ qt6-base-dev
```

### Step 2: Clone and build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Huzaifa-Jamil/Chesscord.git
cd Chesscord/server
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Step 3: Run in background

```bash
nohup ./server > server.log 2>&1 &
```

### Step 4: Open firewall port

In GCP Console → VPC Network → Firewall Rules → allow **TCP port 8080** for all sources (`0.0.0.0/0`).

> **Note:** To connects clients to the Your Own live GCP server at server's IP Address Provided by Cloud provider.
> Copy the IP address at which server is live.
> For connecting Clients to your Online server , change the IP in `client/client.cpp`:
> ```cpp
> pSocket->connectToHost("your server's IP", 8080);
> ```
> Then rebuild the client. (Repeat Step 1,2 and 3)
> Now when you start the client, your server's log will tell about the that client's connection.

```

## Notes

- The server uses **no STL containers**, all data structures are written from scratch.
- Move validation runs on **both sides**: the client validates before sending, the server re validates on receive. A mismatch results in a `GAME|INVALID` response.
- On opponent disconnect mid game, the server sends `WIN|` and `END|` to the surviving player and immediately requeues them.
- Reconnecting from the same IP restores the previous user session automatically.
- All server events are logged via the `Logger` class with timestamped entries.
